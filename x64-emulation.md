Notes:

* Figure out and create recovery media for your device *BEFOREHAND.* its not "if it bricks", it's "when", and "when" is likely "very soon".

Getting x64 Emulation

1. Hop into settings -> updates -> windows insider program.
2. Sign up for the **Insider Channel**
3. Spend the next 5+ hours waiting for windows to install all of the updates
4. Once you've got that done, install this: https://aka.ms/arm64previewredist
5. For the sake of testing you can install Discord, which can only run under x64.
6. Immediately uninstall discord bc it runs horribly in emulation
